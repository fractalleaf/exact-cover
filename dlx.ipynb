    "[Donald Knuth (2000)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047.pdf) describes an algorithm for solving the exact cover problem, which he names \"Algorithm X\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm X works by constructing an indidence matrix, $A$, where each column represents and element in $\\mathcal{X}$ and each row is a set in $\\mathcal{S}$. The example above can be represented by the following matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A = \\begin{bmatrix} \n",

    "   \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by selecting columns and rows in the matrix, and recursivly reduce it until a solution has been found. Technically, the algorithm is a recursive, depth-first backtracking algorithm. The steps of the algorithm are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If A is empty, the problem is solved; return solution.\n",
    "2. Otherwise choose a column, c (deterministically).\n",
    "3. Choose a row, r, such that A[r, c] = 1 (nondeterministically).\n",
    "4. If there is no row in c, such that A[r, c] = 1, there is no solution for this position; return\n",

    "6. For each j such that A[r, j] = 1, \n",
    "     * delete column j from matrix A;\n",
    "     * for each i such that A[i, j] = 1,\n",
    "         - delete row i from matrix A.\n",
    "7. Repeat this algorithm recursively on the reduced matrix A.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to limit the number of recursive calls to the algorithm by always choosing the column with the fewest ones, as this will limit the branching of the search tree that is being traversed.\n",

This implementation has the benefit that the incidence matrix becomes more compact, and that the removal and reinstatement of columns rows can be done by simply changing pointers in memory.\n",
    "\n",

Below is an implementation of DLX in Python, which is heavily inspired by an implementation by [Nicolau Werneck](https://xor0110.wordpress.com/2011/05/09/dlx-in-python-with-actual-pointers/). Python is not known for its speed, so this implementation can be expected to be significantly slower relative to an implementation in a compiled language."
