The problem was chosen because it was known to have a lot of solutions, but relatively few possibilities of placing the pieces on the grid, thus making the problem computationally feasible.\n",

    "To solve the pentomino problem using the DLX algorithm we need to record all valid pentomino positions on the grid. To help with this task, I have created two python classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `Polymino` class takes the polymino name and coordinates as input, and defines methods for manipulating the pentomino position and orientation.\n",
    "* The `Grid` class defines a grid (possibly with holes) on which Polyminoes can be placed. The Grid class checks if each polymino placement in valid.\n",

    "The first step is to create 12 instanes of the `Polymino` class. One for each of the free pentominoes. I have made a convenience function, `generate_polyminoes`, which takes ascii drawings of the polyminoes and generates the `Polymino` instances from those."
